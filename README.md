Monte Carlo Implementation for Polarized Light
=============================================

Project Start Date: July 25, 2015

Goal
----
Match and extend the capabilities of existing monte carlo simulations
regarding the behavior of polarized light in the presence of spherical
or cylindrical scatterers.
