Monte Carlo Implementation for Polarized Light
=============================================

Project Start Date: July 25, 2015

Goal
----
Match and extend the capabilities of existing monte carlo simulations
regarding the behavior of polarized light in the presence of spherical
or cylindrical scatterers.

Modules 
-------
1. Launch and define reference frame, stokes vector
2. Move
3. If exiting medium, rotate stokes vector
