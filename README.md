Modular Monte Carlo for Polarized Light
=============================================
Polarized Monte Carlo in C++

Project Start Date: July 25, 2015

![alt tag](data/cover.png)

Goal
----
Match and extend the capabilities of existing monte carlo simulations
regarding the behavior of polarized light in the presence of spherical
or cylindrical scatterers.

Future Work
-----------

Port this program to Haskell and use `Hmatrix` for linear algebra operations.

- Should have speed comparable to MATLAB (`Hmatrix` is built with LAPACK)

- Higher level operations and functional programming make the program easier
  to write, understand, and maintain.
